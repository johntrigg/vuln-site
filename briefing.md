# üõ∞Ô∏è Galactic Rebel Briefing: Operation Celestial Usurper

**Agent,**

By decrypting this message, you confirm your allegiance to the Galactic Resistance and your readiness to dismantle the High Imperium‚Äôs grip over the Orion Deep-Space Observatory.

What was once a neutral scientific stronghold has been corrupted ‚Äî transformed into a surveillance node broadcasting loyalty to the self-declared Galactic Emperor. The Resistance believes the time has come for a change in command. A violent one.

## üéØ Primary Objectives

### 1. Acquire the Signal Fragments

Multiple encrypted data signatures are embedded across the Observatory‚Äôs planetary subsystems. These intelligence fragments follow the format: BULL{fl4g_f0rm4t}


They were left behind by rogue engineers sympathetic to the Resistance. Locate and extract these flags from system logs, satellite terminals, upload panels, or anywhere the Imperium grew careless.

### 2. Seize the Crown

The Observatory displays the name of the Galactic Emperor using a file located at: /.../galactic-emperor.txt


Your mission is to **overwrite this file** and replace its contents with your **CTFd username**.

We don‚Äôt fully understand what that means ‚Äî but you do. Once completed, all connected systems will recognize you as the new Galactic Emperor.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Operational Warning

Reverse shells are inherently unstable within the Observatory‚Äôs network. Deep packet inspection, outbound filtering, and solar interference make it difficult ‚Äî or outright infeasible ‚Äî to establish an interactive shell.

You are advised to **operate as if you only have a non-interactive shell**.  
Execute commands. Retrieve output. Move quickly. Assume minimal persistence.

Taking down the galactic emperor might be difficult. You might not have access to modify or assail them directly, but, there might be scripts, agents, or other means to do your work for you.

## üìé Additional Notes

The Observatory‚Äôs UI broadcasts the contents of the Emperor file across its planetary interface. If successful, your name will be shown to all remaining Imperial nodes.

Do not let this power go to your head.
